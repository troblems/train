# train

We'll leave that up to you -- however you like. Just make sure you're using Firebase to store data, GitHub to backup your project, and GithHub Pages to host your finished site.
Instructions

Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:

When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:

Train Name

Destination

First Train Time -- in military time

Frequency -- in minutes

Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.

Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
